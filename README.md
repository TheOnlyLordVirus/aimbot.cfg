Natashas 2014 MW2 PS3 CFG aimbot.

This aimbot will work on Dev Builds, Retail copys, Private servers, Hacked builds, Patched builds, ect, ect... Of Call of Duty games.

These are standard Call of Duty commands for the CLI.

Load a dev build of call of duty and run the command: ```"exec aimbot.cfg"```, using the CLI (```'~'``` Tilda key), while this file is in the same directory as the executable for the game.

Otherwise, depending on the game, you might be able to load the ```"exec aimbot.cfg"``` command, in to the command buffer using RPC.

Otherwise, older call of duty's contain varrious exploits for executing dvars on the client though hacked saves, isos, and other means (See CFG Infections)
